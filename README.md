# Before you can run React
- Please install `Nodejs` to run React: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation and Execution Steps

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. You can check if Node.js is installed by opening your preferred command-line tool (e.g., Terminal, Command Prompt) and typing `node -v`. If Node.js is installed, it will display the version number. If it's not installed, please follow the [official Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org) to install it.

2. Navigate to the Source Code folder on your computer. For example, if the folder is located at `C:\Submission`, open your command-line tool and navigate to that folder using the `cd` command:

```shell
cd C:\Submission
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies by executing the following command:

```shell
npm install
npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react
```

4. Start the application by executing the following command:
```shell
npm start
```
